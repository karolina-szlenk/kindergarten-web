## General info
Welcome to the GitHub repo for Zielona Laka website! This is a multi-page website of a kindergarten called Zielona Laka, which is located in Lebork, Poland. The website is used to present current information about the facility and the current offer in order to attract new customers. The advantages of the website are - convenient navigation and modern design. The website is fully responsive and can be viewed by popular browsers.

## Features
* information sections about - offer, daily schedule, recruitment, kindergarten and so on
* news - information and announcements on current events
* downloadable list of documents, in pdf format
* menu updated once a week
* gallery
* contact section where you can find a link to the facebook page, dial a phone number directly using mobile or write an email

## Live
http://www.zielona-laka.pl/
	
## Technologies
Project is created using:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS

The reasons for the use of certain technologies are the desire to improve these skills, easy operation and posibility to quick modification. In the future, I am going to implement a webpack to have files as one bundle and maybe set up a small database for the news and gallery sections, so it won`t be kept on the client side.

## Photos and images
All photos on the website, except for the gallery, come from https://www.freepik.com.
Pictures and logo of the kindergarten were made by me with GIMP and Inkscape.
